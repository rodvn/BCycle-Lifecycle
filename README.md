What is BCycle? https://austinbcycle.com/
tldr: it's a bike rental service in Austin, TX.

In this data mining project I am trying to predict the lifespan (in months) of a BCycle bike using a dataset of trips spanning several years. I will be using supervised learning with the label being the actual lifespan of a bike calculated from this dataset.

I started this project with my team for DataHacks 2019 at UT Austin. Credits to my team for helping me come up with this cool idea and helping with the initial setup. Also, credits to the DataHacks organizers for providing this dataset. We couldn't finish the project due to time constraints so I decided to continue on my own.

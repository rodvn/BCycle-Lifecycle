What is BCycle? (https://austinbcycle.com/)

In this data mining project I am trying to predict the lifespan (in months) of a BCycle bike using a dataset of trips spanning several years.

I started this project with my team for DataHacks 2019 at UT Austin. We couldn't finish the project due to time constraints so I decided to continue on my own.
